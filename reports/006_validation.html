## Suspicious Patterns Detected

## Recommendations

Fix FAKE tests by implementing real conversation logic:
  - tests/test_communicator_conversations.py::test_conversation_timeout: Only found 2 conversation indicators
  - tests/test_communicator_conversations.py::test_conversation_analytics: Found 4 conversation indicators (failed cross-examination)
Strengthen evidence in tests with weak validation:
  - tests/test_communicator_conversations.py::test_infinite_conversation: Add more conversation indicators
