## Suspicious Patterns Detected

- ⚠️ ALL non-honeypot tests passed - could be overconfident!
- ⚠️ Test durations are suspiciously uniform!
- ⚠️ 4 tests have ≥95% confidence - check for overconfidence!

## Recommendations

Fix FAKE tests by implementing real conversation logic:
  - tests/test_arango_conversations_mock.py::test_missing_conversation: Duration 0.000s is impossibly fast for multi-turn conversation
