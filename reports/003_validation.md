## Suspicious Patterns Detected

- ⚠️ ALL non-honeypot tests passed - could be overconfident!
- ⚠️ Test durations are suspiciously uniform!
- ⚠️ 2 tests have ≥95% confidence - check for overconfidence!

## Recommendations

Strengthen evidence in tests with weak validation:
  - tests/test_conversation_message.py::test_no_timestamp: Add more conversation indicators
