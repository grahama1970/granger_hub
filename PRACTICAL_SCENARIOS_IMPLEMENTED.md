# Practical Scenarios Implementation Summary

## âœ… What We Accomplished

### Initial Request
The user correctly identified that while we had created 10 creative, complex scenarios testing advanced communication patterns, we were missing **simple, practical scenarios** that users would actually run in real-world situations.

### Implementation Complete

We successfully created **7 practical scenarios** that test real-world document processing workflows:

1. **pdf_page_screenshot_scenario.py**
   - Navigate to specific page (e.g., page 40)
   - Take a screenshot
   - Basic building block for document analysis

2. **table_detection_extraction_scenario.py**
   - Detect tables in documents
   - Check confidence scores
   - Extract only if confidence > 95%
   - Tests conditional logic based on AI output

3. **document_qa_scenario.py**
   - Load a document
   - Ask specific questions
   - Get answers with relevant sections
   - Common use case for document understanding

4. **multi_step_processing_scenario.py**
   - Complete workflow: Navigate â†’ Screenshot â†’ Detect â†’ Extract
   - Tests the exact scenario the user described
   - Shows conditional processing based on results

5. **info_extraction_scenario.py**
   - Extract structured data (dates, names, amounts)
   - Entity recognition and formatting
   - Common for invoice/form processing

6. **document_comparison_scenario.py**
   - Compare two document versions
   - Find differences and changes
   - Calculate similarity scores

7. **data_validation_scenario.py**
   - Extract form data
   - Validate against business rules
   - Generate validation reports

### Comprehensive Run Script

Created **run_all_scenarios.sh** that organizes all 17 scenarios:

\`\`\`bash
# Run specific scenarios
./run_all_scenarios.sh pdf_screenshot
./run_all_scenarios.sh table_extract

# Run categories
./run_all_scenarios.sh practical  # All 7 practical scenarios
./run_all_scenarios.sh creative   # All 10 creative scenarios
./run_all_scenarios.sh all        # Everything

# List available scenarios
./run_all_scenarios.sh list
\`\`\`

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievement

We now have a **balanced test suite** that covers:
- **Real-world use cases** that users actually need
- **Complex communication patterns** for advanced testing
- **Conditional logic** based on module outputs
- **Multi-step workflows** with decision points

## ðŸ“Š Total Scenarios: 17

- 10 Creative Complex Scenarios
- 7 Practical Simple Scenarios

All scenarios are ready to test the claude-module-communicator's ability to orchestrate modules for both simple tasks and complex multi-agent systems.
