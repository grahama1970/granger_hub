# Creative Module-Specific Scenarios - Implementation Summary

## üöÄ What We Accomplished

You were absolutely right - my initial "simple" scenarios were too generic! You provided excellent examples that actually leverage the **specific modules** available in the ecosystem. I've now created truly creative scenarios that integrate:

- **Marker** - Advanced PDF extraction
- **ArXiv bot** - Scientific paper search
- **SPARTA** - Security knowledge base (NIST, MITRE)
- **YouTube transcripts** - Video content analysis
- **Git operations** - Code management
- **Hardware verification** - Specification validation

## ‚ú® New Creative Module-Specific Scenarios (5)

### 1. Scientific Paper Validation
**File**: 
- Extract PDF with Marker (claims, methodology, figures)
- Analyze claims to generate search queries
- Find supporting papers via ArXiv bot
- Find refuting papers via ArXiv bot
- Generate validation report with controversy score

### 2. NIST Compliance Check
**File**: 
- Extract "shall" requirements with Marker
- Parse and categorize requirements
- Check against SPARTA NIST controls (AC, AU, SC, SI)
- Generate compliance report with risk assessment

### 3. Codebase Enhancement Pipeline
**File**: 
- Deep code analysis for improvement areas
- Search YouTube for relevant tutorials
- Find academic papers on ArXiv
- Create feature branch
- Implement improvements
- Run tests
- Merge if tests pass

### 4. CWE Security Analysis
**File**: 
- Parse source code
- Check against SPARTA MITRE CWE database
- Analyze vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Generate remediation plan with fixes

### 5. Hardware Verification Q&A
**File**: 
- Extract tables from hardware specs with Marker
- Structure and normalize data
- Load IEEE/JEDEC verification standards
- Answer specific verification questions
- Identify compliance issues

## üéØ Key Improvements Over Generic Scenarios

### Before (Generic):
- "Navigate to page 40 and screenshot"
- "Detect tables and extract"
- "Load document and answer questions"

### After (Module-Specific):
- "Extract this PDF with Marker and find papers that support AND refute it"
- "Check if requirements violate NIST controls from SPARTA"
- "Analyze code for CWE violations using SPARTA's MITRE database"
- "Get improvement ideas from YouTube/ArXiv and implement in new branch"

## üìä Total Scenario Count: 22

- **7 Practical Simple Scenarios** (document processing basics)
- **10 Creative Complex Scenarios** (communication patterns)
- **5 Creative Module-Specific Scenarios** (leveraging real modules) ‚Üê NEW!

## üöÄ Running the New Scenarios



## üí° More Creative Ideas for Future Implementation

Based on your excellent suggestions:

1. **Figure Plagiarism Detection**
   - Extract figures from PDF with Marker
   - Search ArXiv for similar images
   - Flag potential violations

2. **Requirements to Threat Mapping**
   - Given requirements, find related MITRE tactics/techniques
   - Map to kill chain phases
   - Generate threat model

3. **Multi-Source Learning Integration**
   - Combine YouTube tutorials + ArXiv papers + GitHub examples
   - Generate comprehensive learning path
   - Auto-implement best practices

4. **Cross-Module Validation**
   - Use multiple modules to validate same content
   - Compare results for consistency
   - Flag discrepancies

These scenarios show the TRUE power of the module communicator - orchestrating real, powerful tools to solve complex problems!
