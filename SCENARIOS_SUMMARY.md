# Claude Module Communicator - Scenarios Summary

## Overview

We have created a comprehensive test suite with **17 scenarios** that test the claude-module-communicator's capabilities across two categories:

### 1. Creative Complex Scenarios (10 scenarios)
These test advanced communication patterns and multi-agent orchestration:

- **DataSymphony**: Multi-stage data transformation with parallel processing
- **WebScraper**: Intelligent web scraping with adaptive strategies
- **StoryBuilder**: Collaborative story creation with multiple creative agents
- **DebateClub**: Multi-perspective debate simulation with consensus building
- **GameMaster**: Interactive game orchestration with state management
- **CreativeJam**: Real-time creative collaboration with feedback loops
- **TimeMachine**: Historical data transformation across time periods
- **ResearchConsensus**: Multi-agent negotiation reaching agreement
- **DynamicExplorer**: Conditional branching based on discoveries
- **TrainingPipeline**: Cross-domain translation from research to training

### 2. Practical Simple Scenarios (7 scenarios)
These test real-world document processing workflows:

- **PDFScreenshot**: Navigate to specific PDF page and take screenshot
- **TableExtraction**: Detect tables and extract if confidence > 95%
- **DocumentQA**: Load document and answer questions about content
- **MultiStep**: Complete workflow (navigate→screenshot→detect→extract)
- **InfoExtraction**: Extract structured data (dates, names, amounts)
- **DocCompare**: Compare two document versions for differences
- **DataValidation**: Validate extracted data against business rules

## Implementation Details

All scenarios inherit from ScenarioBase and implement:
1. setup_modules() - Define required modules
2. create_workflow() - Create message flow
3. process_results() - Process and summarize results

The communicator handles message routing, state management, and result aggregation automatically.
