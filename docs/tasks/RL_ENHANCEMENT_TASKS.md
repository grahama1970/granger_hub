## 📜 Definitions and Rules
- **REAL Test**: A test that interacts with live systems (Ollama server, ArangoDB) and meets minimum performance criteria (e.g., duration > 0.1s for LLM calls).  
- **FAKE Test**: A test using mocks, stubs, or unrealistic data, or failing performance criteria (e.g., instant LLM responses).  
- **Confidence Threshold**: Tests with <90% confidence are automatically marked FAKE.
- **Status Indicators**:  
  - ✅ Complete: All tests passed as REAL, verified in final loop.  
  - ⏳ In Progress: Actively running test loops.  
  - 🚫 Blocked: Waiting for dependencies (listed).  
  - 🔄 Not Started: No tests run yet.  
- **Validation Rules**:  
  - Test durations must be within expected ranges (LLM calls: 0.5s-30s).  
  - Tests must produce verifiable outputs with real data.  
  - Self-reported confidence must be ≥90% with supporting evidence.
  - Maximum 3 test loops per task; escalate failures to project lead.  
- **Environment Setup**:  
  - Python 3.10+, pytest 8.3+  
  - Ollama server running locally (port 11434)  
  - At least one Ollama model installed  
  - ArangoDB for episode storage

## 📊 Overall Progress

### By Status:
- ✅ Complete: 0 ([])  
- ⏳ In Progress: 0 ([])  
- 🚫 Blocked: 0 ([])  
- 🔄 Not Started: 8 ([#001-#008])  

### Self-Reporting Patterns:
- Always Certain (≥95%): 0 tasks ([])  
- Mixed Certainty (50-94%): 0 tasks ([])  
- Always Uncertain (<50%): 0 tasks ([])
- Average Confidence: N/A
- Honeypot Detection Rate: 0/0 (Should be 100% when tested)

### Next Steps:
1. Start with TASK #001 (JSON Parsing) as it's critical for all LLM interactions
2. Implement TASK #002 (Episode Storage) to enable learning
3. Complete TASK #003 (Real-Time Collection) to gather training data
4. Continue through remaining tasks in order

### Notes:
- All tasks require real Ollama server interaction (no mocking)
- Episode storage must use real ArangoDB instance
- Performance metrics must reflect actual system behavior
- Honeypot tests ensure we're not faking results
