# Ollama Integration for RL Training

## Overview

The RL system now uses your local Ollama server with the  model for all optimization tasks. This provides significantly better performance compared to smaller models.

## Configuration

### Ollama Server Details

- **Docker Container**: Running on your system
- **Internal Access** (when SSH'd): 
- **External Access**: 
- **Model**:  (30B parameters, 8-bit quantized)

### Key Features

1. **Route Optimization**: Uses Ollama to find optimal communication paths
2. **Schema Adaptation**: Generates schema transformations with minimal data loss
3. **Module Selection**: Intelligently selects modules based on capabilities and load

## Files Created

All RL files are now in :

1. **ollama_integration.py** - Direct Ollama client for RL tasks
2. **rewards.py** - DeepRetrieval-style reward system
3. **episodes.py** - Episode collection using Ollama
4. **__init__.py** - Package initialization

Examples:
- **rl_training_with_ollama.py** - Demonstrates Ollama integration

## Usage Example



## Model Performance

The  model provides:

- **Better reasoning**: More sophisticated route optimization
- **Accurate JSON**: Reliable structured output
- **Context awareness**: Better understanding of module relationships
- **Lower temperature**: More consistent results (0.3 for routing, 0.2 for schemas)

## Integration Points

1. **Episode Collection**: Ollama generates optimized solutions
2. **Reward Calculation**: Based on Ollama's performance vs baseline
3. **Graph Storage**: All episodes stored in ArangoDB
4. **Continuous Learning**: System improves with more data

## Running the Demo



## Next Steps

1. **Full RL Training**: Integrate with VERL for PPO training
2. **Production Deployment**: Use learned policies in real communications
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track improvements over baseline
4. **Model Fine-tuning**: Consider fine-tuning for your specific use case

The larger model significantly improves the quality of RL optimization, making the system more effective at learning optimal communication strategies.
